# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview Of The Analysis:
V.Isualize instructed me to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data for each city type. The purpose of the project was to determine the demand for rideshares and help improve access to rideshare services in rural, suburban, and urban cities. I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. My results can help improve rideshare services for each city type moving forward. 

My first analysis, *PyBer* provided data for each specific city based on the average fare price and the number of rides per city. As you can see from my scatter chart, urban cities made up the largest portion of total rides.

We can also view the same results by examining my pie chart which portrays the exact percentages of rides for each city type.

As you can see, urban cities consisted of 68.4% of all rides compared to suburban and urban cities which were far less. 

My second analysis, #PyBer_Challenge* focuses on the total weekly fares for each city type. I portrayed my data using a line graph that provides V.Isualize information based on each city type and the amount of fares per month between January and May of 2019. See results below.

## Results:
As you can see from my line graph above, urban cities("lightgreen") show how fares in urban cities fluctuated between $1,600 to nearly $2,500 over the 5 months. Suburban cities("lightblue"), however, consisted of far less and fluctuated between $1,400 to nearly $700 over the same 5-month period in 2019. The last city type was rural cities and had the lowest total fares over the same period. Rural cities reached a high point of $500 in April and stayed below that threshold throughout the previous months. One thing to take note of is that April was the highest amount of total fares for each type in 2019. It would be a smart business move to ensure that each city type had enough drivers for that time frame in the upcoming years. 

The chart below demonstrates the amount of total drivers, total rides, total fares, and average fares per ride and driver for each city type. As you can see the average fare per driver for rural cities is much higher compared to suburban and urban locations. These prices could correlate with the amount of total drivers available which was only 78, thus a higher fee is charged. Alternatively, in urban cities the amount of total drivers was 1,625 and the average fare per driver was only $16.57.

## Summary:
To conclude my analysis I will summarize my findings.
- Urban cities made up the largest portion of total rides (%68.4) compared to suburban (%26.3) and rural (%5.3).
- Rural cities hade the least amount of total drivers (78) and the highest average fares per driver ($55.49), thus their are more drivers and riders in urban and suburban cities. 
- Due to the more expensive fare prices experienced in rural cities, the total amount of rides is far lower than the other two cities.
- The majority of PyBer's revenue comes from urban cities.

PyBer could increase their amount of drivers available in rural cities to help promote more rides and decrease the average fare price to promote better business and demand in the area.
